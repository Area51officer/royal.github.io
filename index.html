<h1 style="color:red; text-align:center;">What is Lorem Ipsum?
</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s<br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html" style="border:2px solid Tomato;">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.

<p>This is the most accurate natural color images of Pluto taken by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in 2015.
These natural-color images result from refined calibration of data gathered by New Horizons' color Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC). The processing creates images that would approximate the colors that the human eye would perceive, bringing them closer to “true color” than the images released near the encounter.
This image was taken as New Horizons zipped toward Pluto and its moons on July 14, 2015, from a range of 22,025 miles (35,445) kilometers. This single color MVIC scan includes no data from other New Horizons imagers or instruments added. The striking features on Pluto are clearly visible, including the bright expanse of Pluto's icy, nitrogen-and-methane rich "heart," Sputnik Planitia.
