<h1 style="color:red; text-align:center;">What is Lorem Ipsum?
</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s<br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
